# quotos

A stupid quotes tracking platform for myself and you. Every now and then I come across
interesting quotes or text snippets in movies, books, poems, speeches,
discussions, anime etc


I can't count how many files i've created to track these. It is also more
cumbersome to look for any of those files, and then start to try to read them :-)

More inspiration is needed for that than to visit a webpage or webapp and add a given quote or interesting text snippet so I can visit any time and from anywhere.

Also, making it a webapp exposes it to others to contribute too. More awareness
will be created and there will be some sort of sharing and discovery...
